With a diagnosis of dementia, you or another member of your loved one's care circle will, most likely, become responsible for making medical and financial decisions for them.  While this can be a situation that is wrought with discomfort and even avoidance, it is critical to get the proper medical and financial documents in order.  Seeking the advice of an attorney who specializes in elder care law is a worthwhile investment of time and money.  A good attorney will help you to get your loved ones legal and financial affairs in order and can help demystify an overwhelming experience.

A medical directive, also called a Living Will or Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, will cover directions regarding medical procedures to be taken on behalf of your loved one. Having this document in order allows your loved one to make choices regarding their end-of-life care.  It also prevents confusion and disagreements among family members. 

A last will and testament will help avoid legal battles between children and will keep an estate out of probate court.  It also allows a person to make his final wishes known on a variety of matters related to property. 

Hopefully, your elder has shown someone in his care circle where these documents are kept. Early in the transition to caretaking, family members may spend months trying to locate these important documents.  If a Durable Power of Attorney has been put in place, the person indicated in the POA should assume access to all financial paperwork. She should create list of all checking and savings accounts, documents related to loans and mortgages, and pensions and investments.
