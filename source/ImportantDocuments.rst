With a diagnosis of dementia, you or another member of your loved one's care circle will, most likely, become responsible for making medical and financial decisions for them.  While this can be a situation that is wrought with discomfort and even avoidance, it is critical to get the proper medical and financial documents in order *before* your elder is no longer able to participate in making their wishes clear.

A medical directive, also called a Living Will or Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, will cover directions regarding medical procedures to be taken on behalf of your loved one. Having this document in order allow your loved one to make choices regarding their end-of-life care.  It also prevents confusion and disagreements among family members. 

Your elder may not have put a will in place. Sometime people avoid creating wills or updating old wills because it feels morbid.  There are many reasons to write a last will and testament.  Primarily, it will help avoid legal battles between children and will keep an estate out of probate court.  It also allows a person to make his final wishes known on a variety of matters related to property. 

Finally, it is helpful if your elder has shown someone in his care circle where his financial paperwork is kept. There should be a list of all checking and savings accounts, documents related to loans and mortgages, and pensions and investements.  Early in the transition to caretaking, family members may spend months trying to locate these important documents.  Hopefully, a Durable Power of Attorney has been put in place.  It is essential that the person indicated in the POA has access to all financial paperwork.
