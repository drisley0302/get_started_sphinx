Safe at Home
##############

A diagnosis of dementia has been made. Of course, this has, most likely, been a shock to both you and your loved one.  Now what? Is it possible for a person diagnosed with dementia to remain in their home?  The answer is a resounding "yes" - at least for a while.
Now that your loved one and concerned family or friends understand the cognitive difficulties that your loved one is facing, a decision may be made for him/her to remain in the home for as long as possible. It is common for a person with dementia to refuse help in their home, However, with support, many people can remain in their homes.  
The following are ways to provide a safe in-home support system.

- *Neighbors* Leave a set of house keys with a trusted neighbor.	Make sure there is access to the home, and someone can enter the home if a problem arises.

- *Phone Check-ins* Arrange for someone to call or visit your loved one daily.	

- *Purchase a medical alert system*  Consider one that is wearable. Research the service that is the best fit for your loved one's needs.

- *Appliance safety*  Consider upgrading appliances to those that have automatic shut off. Tea kettles, coffee makers, even stove tops can be installed with automatic shut off timers. Remove fuses in the oven and shut off the gas. Lower hot water heater temperature.

- *Phone System* Install a phone that can be programmed with phone numbers of your love done's care circle and emergency help.  Seek out phones_ that are designed for elderly or memory impaired individuals.

- *Organize Clothing* Go through your loved ones closets and drawers. Pack away all clothing that is unnecessary or difficult to manage.  Manipulating zippers and buttons might require multitasking abilities or fine motor skills that are diminished. Make getting dressed easy by reducing clothing choices.


- *Medication* 	Simplify medication routines. Set up a pill dispenser for your loved one and have someone in his/her care circle help administer their daily medication. Medication routines should not be left soley to the individual once a diagnosis of dementia has been made.
